# Authentication-using-JsonWebToken-in-node-js

--------------Step 1 ------------------------------
I have used REST CLIENT here you can use POSTMAN...
Rest client is a extension provided in visual studio code itself so you don't have to change the application you can test in studio.


-----------------------steo 2 ------------------------
.eslintrc.json file is used to ignore the eslint warnings and errors.


ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
