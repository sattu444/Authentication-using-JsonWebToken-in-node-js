# Authentication-using-JsonWebToken-in-node-js

--------------Step 1------------------------------
I have used REST CLIENT here you can use POSTMAN...

Rest client is a extension provided in visual studio code 
where you don't have to change the application you can test in studio.


-----------------------step 2------------------------
.eslintrc.json file is used to ignore the eslint warnings and errors.


ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
